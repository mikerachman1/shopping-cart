This is a faux online shop built using React. 

The site has 3 different pages: About, Shop, and Cart.

On the Shop Page a user can browse products and add them to their cart. A sticky header lets the user keep track of their total and cart contents while still on the Shop page. 

On the Cart Page a user can edit their cart contents by changing the quantity of a specific Item or by deleting an Item. 

The "Complete Order" button has no functionality, checking out is beyond the scope of this project.
